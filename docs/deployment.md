# YSearch2 - Deployment Guide

## Deployment Options

YSearch2 can be deployed in several ways depending on your infrastructure and requirements:

### 1. Manual Deployment

For local development and testing:

1. Start the backend API:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at:
- Backend API on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend on http://localhost:3000

### 2. Cloud Platforms

#### AWS Deployment
1. Set up EC2 instances for the backend and frontend
2. Deploy the backend service
3. Deploy the frontend service
4. Set up RDS for PostgreSQL
5. Set up ElastiCache for Redis

#### Google Cloud Deployment
1. Set up Compute Engine instances
2. Deploy the backend and frontend services
3. Use Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
4. Use Memorystore for Redis

#### Azure Deployment
1. Set up Virtual Machines for the backend and frontend
2. Deploy the backend and frontend services
3. Use Azure Database for PostgreSQL
4. Use Azure Cache for Redis

## Environment Variables

### Backend
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string
- `YOUTU_API_KEY`: Tencent Youtu API key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for DSPy (if using GPT models)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key for JWT tokens
- `ENV`: Environment (development, staging, production)

### Frontend
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Backend API URL
- `REACT_APP_ENV`: Environment (development, staging, production)

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Backend services can be scaled horizontally
- Use a load balancer to distribute traffic
- Ensure database connections are properly pooled

### Database Scaling
- Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Implement proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Consider partitioning for very large datasets

### Caching Strategy
- Use Redis for caching frequent queries
- Implement CDN for static assets
- Cache personalized results with appropriate TTL

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery

### Network Security
- Use firewalls to restrict access
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Regularly update and patch systems

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Monitoring
- Use the built-in metrics endpoints
- Set up alerts for critical metrics
- Monitor error rates and response times

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Monitor network traffic
- Set up alerts for resource constraints

### Logging
- Implement structured logging
- Centralize logs for easier analysis
- Retain logs according to compliance requirements

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### Database Backup
- Implement regular automated backups
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Store backups in multiple geographic locations

### Configuration Backup
- Version control all configuration files
- Store secrets securely (e.g., HashiCorp Vault)
- Document recovery procedures

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper indexing
- Optimize queries

### Caching Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement cache warming
- Use appropriate cache eviction policies

### Code Optimization
- Profile and optimize slow functions
- Use asynchronous processing where appropriate
- Implement efficient algorithms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Services not starting**
   - Check logs for error messages
   - Verify environment variables
   - Ensure dependencies are available

2. **Slow response times**
   - Check database performance
   - Review caching strategy
   - Profile application code

3. **Authentication failures**
   - Verify JWT token configuration
   - Check user database
   - Review permission settings

### Debugging Tips

1. Enable debug logging in development
2. Use database query logs to identify slow queries
3. Monitor system resources during peak usage
4. Use APM tools for detailed performance insights

## Updating the Application

### Blue-Green Deployment
1. Deploy new version to inactive environment
2. Test thoroughly
3. Switch traffic to new version
4. Decommission old version

### Rolling Updates
1. Update services one at a time
2. Monitor for issues
3. Roll back if problems occur

## Compliance and Regulations

### GDPR
- Implement data deletion mechanisms
- Provide data export functionality
- Obtain proper consent for data processing

### HIPAA (if applicable)
- Encrypt all data transmission and storage
- Implement audit logging
- Sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Apply security patches
- Update dependencies
- Review and rotate secrets
- Clean up old data according to retention policies

### Support Channels
- File issues on the GitHub repository
- Join the community Slack/Discord
- Contact enterprise support (if applicable)
